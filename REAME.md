The Backend Project is divided into 3 modules.
1. DB: This modules holds the MyBatis Schema Migration System. Which is kind of a version control system for our database.
To set up, read the README.md under db/.
To run migrate commands, the path and environment have to be specified e.g. migrate st --env=development --path=C:\Android\ITT\itt-backend\src\main\kotlin\com\itt\db\migrations

2. Data: This module holds the domain level code that connects our backend to our application. The artifacts are generated by the Mybatis Generator (MBG)
